I Hope you enjoy. :)

This a simple snake game developed with the intention of improving my "DOM Manipulation" skills in Javascript.

Used Resources: 
Simple HTML file. <br>
CSS file for styling. <br>
Only simple DOM Manipulation, including querySelector, addEventListener, createElement and createTextNode. All available in ES5. <br>
I've used, also, localStorage, so you're capacle to remain your difficulty level, even if you close your browser. <br>
Among ES6+ resources, I used only template literals, that can be easily replaced by string concatenation. <br>


OBS:
I haven't used SASS, so CSS file isn't all compatible to older browsers, but you don't use IE anyway, hahaha.
