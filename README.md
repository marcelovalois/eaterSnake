I Hope you enjoy. :)

This a simple snake game developed with the intention of improving my "DOM Manipulation" skills in Javascript.

Used Resources:
<ul> </li>
<li>Simple HTML file. <br></li>
<li>CSS file for styling. <br></li>
<li>Only simple DOM Manipulation, including querySelector, addEventListener, createElement and createTextNode. All available in ES5. <br></li>
<li>I've used, also, localStorage, so you're capacle to remain your difficulty level, even if you close your browser. <br></li>
<li>Among ES6+ resources, I used only template literals, that can be easily replaced by string concatenation. <br></li>
  </ul>


OBS:
I haven't used SASS, so CSS file isn't all compatible to older browsers, but you don't use IE anyway, hahaha.
